# detection-ripness-and-distance-measurement-of-strawberry
Strawberry detection by using the YOLOv8 model, Ripeness measurement of strawberry by using OpenCV and Measure distance of strawberry from the Depth Camera for Strawberry harvesting robots.

* Before you start, I recommend that you study the Physical Properties of Strawberry or Object that you want to detect, OpenCV, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, various color values, study measuring the distance between the object and the camera. and research related to your work. The scope of my work involves strawberry harvesting robots.

# Install Package & Library

* Install the libraries that will be used for the detection system and measure distance.
  Ex. os, datetime, sqrt, ultralytics, openni, cv2 or numpy etc.

# Select Framework for train model

* I select Model [YOLOv8 ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
(You can learn the details of the model I chose from the link.)

# Prepare Data

*Prepare your dataset. You should get a lot of images of the objects you are interested in detecting in order to train the model. Because the bigger the data, the better the performance of your model.

*Store data in the same folder.
