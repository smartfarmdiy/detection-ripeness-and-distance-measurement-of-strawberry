# detection-ripness-and-distance-measurement-of-strawberry
Strawberry detection by using the YOLOv8 model, Ripeness measurement of strawberry by using OpenCV and Measure distance of strawberry from the Depth Camera for Strawberry harvesting robots.

* Before you start, I recommend that you study the Physical Properties of Strawberry, OpenCV, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, various color values, study measuring the distance between the object and the camera. and research related to your work. The scope of my work involves strawberry harvesting robots.

# Install Package & Library

* Install the libraries that will be used for the detection system and measure distance.
  Ex. os, datetime, sqrt, ultralytics, openni, cv2 or numpy etc.

# Select Framework for train model

* I select Model [YOLOv8 ultralytics](https://www.example.com](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
(You can learn the details of the model I chose from the link.)
