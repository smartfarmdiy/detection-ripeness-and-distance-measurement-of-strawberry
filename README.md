# detection-ripness-and-distance-measurement-of-strawberry
Strawberry detection by using the YOLOv8 model, Ripeness measurement of strawberry by using OpenCV and Measure distance of strawberry from the Depth Camera for Strawberry harvesting robots.

* Before you start, I recommend that you study the Physical Properties of Strawberry or Object that you want to detect, OpenCV, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, various color values, study measuring the distance between the object and the camera. and research related to your work. The scope of my work involves strawberry harvesting robots.

# Install Package & Library

* Install the libraries that will be used for the detection system and measure distance.
  Ex. os, datetime, sqrt, ultralytics, openni, cv2 or numpy etc.

# Select Framework for train model

* I select Model [YOLOv8 ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
(You can learn the details of the model I chose from the link.)

# Prepare Data

* Prepare your dataset. You should get a lot of images of the objects you are interested in detecting in order to train the model. Because the bigger the data, the better the performance of your model.

* Store data in the same folder.

# Annotation

* You will need to annotate the data set of your images. This can be done in [Roboflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuZtUMEiKWY&list=PLrQjg-8WJZpOnfbFXyOfLlVfkQnRUCjCO&index=13), [CVAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9fH9OWn8YM&list=PLrQjg-8WJZpOnfbFXyOfLlVfkQnRUCjCO&index=12), or any other appropriate platform. You can see an example from the link I attached.

* After that, you need to divide the data into Train and Test, then add Augmentation to add flexibility to our dataset, and then generate data to prepare for the next train model (you can follow the link from above)

# Train Model

* In my part of the model training process, I will do it in Google Colab Pro (Because my data is big), where you need to import the dataset you have already created into Google Drive first.

* After that you need to connect Colab Pro to your Google Drive and import the library.

<pre>
import os
import torch
from ultralytics import YOLO
</pre>

* Code for train

Choose a model based on the capabilities of your computer or GPU. The larger the model, the higher the power required to run. Or the smaller the model, the less power is required to run.

from above info you can click [YOLOv8 ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) to lerning more.
<pre>
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.yaml")

# Use the model
results = model.train(data="/content/drive/MyDrive/Strawberry_dataset/google_colab_config.yaml", epochs=200, imgsz =640)
</pre>

* If error this code is Load Checkpoint to continuous

<pre>
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("/content/drive/MyDrive/Strawberry_dataset/33resume/detect/train/weights/last.pt")

# Resume training
results = model.train(resume = True)
</pre>

# Detection for Strawberry

* After training the model is finished, you will get the model in the form of best.pt and last.pt files for use in our object detection. You can set the file path and put it in my code and try to detect the objects you want.

# Ripeness Measurement

To measure the ripeness of my strawberries I will use the color value technique, within my code it will give the ripeness level as follows:

- Unripe will be set <= 25% of ripeness.

- Turning will be set <= 50% of ripeness

- Partially Ripe is will be set <= 75% of ripeness

- Fully Ripe will be set <= 100% of ripeness

- Rotten will be set 0% of ripeness

* Define the minimum and maximum color values for class

<pre>
min_color_unripe = (0, 128, 0)
max_color_turning = (255, 255, 255)

min_color_PartiallyRipe = (0, 35, 129)
max_color_turning1 = (255, 255, 255)
</pre>

* Function to calculate percentage within a range

<pre>
def calculate_percentage(value, min_value, max_value):
    # Ensure that the value is within the specified range
    value = (max(min_value[0], min(max_value[0], value[0])),
             max(min_value[1], min(max_value[1], value[1])),
             max(min_value[2], min(max_value[2], value[2])))

    # Calculate the percentage for each channel (B, G, R)
    percentage_b = ((value[0] - min_value[0]) / (max_value[0] - min_value[0])) * 100
    percentage_g = ((value[1] - min_value[1]) / (max_value[1] - min_value[1])) * 100
    percentage_r = ((value[2] - min_value[2]) / (max_value[2] - min_value[2])) * 100

    # Calculate the average percentage across channels
    percentage = (percentage_b + percentage_g + percentage_r) / 3.0
 
    return percentage
</pre>

* Code for specifying the color range There will be an average of the color values within the Bounding Box of that strawberry. This is then compared to a given color range where I will give the fruit green to white at 0 % ripeness to 25 % ripeness and from white to red at 25 % ripeness to 100 % ripeness. Rotten results will be given as 0 % ripeness (ripeness color value or percentage of ripeness Different for each fruit which you can use my code as a reference in your work)

<pre>
if (min_color_unripe <= avg_color).all() and (avg_color <= max_color_turning).all():

    percentage = calculate_percentage(avg_color, min_color_unripe, max_color_turning)
    color_rec = (0, int(255 * (1 - percentage / 100)), int(255 * (percentage / 100)))
    ripeness_percentage = percentage * (25 / 100)

elif (min_color_PartiallyRipe <= avg_color).all() and (avg_color <= max_color_turning1).all():

    percentage = calculate_percentage(avg_color, min_color_PartiallyRipe, max_color_turning1)
    color_rec = (0, int(255 * (1 - percentage / 100)), int(255 * (percentage / 100)))
    ripeness_percentage = ((100 - percentage) * (75 / 100)) + 25
</pre>
